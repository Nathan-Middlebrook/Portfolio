Projects from school
For the Databases and Web project, we were supposed to create a website that would access a database and then display information.  There were two phases to this project.  The first phase was written using asp.net or php.  In the second phase, we switched code with another student who was not using the same language we started with.  For phase two we were then supposed to add insert and delete options to the website.  In my case, I started with asp.net for the first phase and used php in the second phase.  The actual database that was used for this project is no longer available.

GroupBy is one of the MapReduce programs I wrote while working as a member of an Arizona State University research team.  It expects an input file called GBData.csv where each line is a vector and the first column is the aggregation attribute.  All vectors should be of the same dimensionality and the aggregation attribute is not included as a dimension of the vector.
Usage: bin/hadoop jar GroupBy.jar GroupBy <agg method> <numReducers> <dimensionality>
Aggregation choices: 1=Avg, 2=Count, 3=Min, 4=Max, 5=Sum

Matrix is a program I wrote in C while learning about multiprocessing and multithreading.  Given two matrices, it will calculate the product.
